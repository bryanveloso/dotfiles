# dotfiles

These are my `.files`. They help me keep my life sane when I switch between my
beloved iMac and MacBook Air.

## Installation

Want to give this a shot? Actually, that's rhetorical since I'm asking myself
that question. This is here so I don't forget since I'm prone to doing so.

    curl https://raw.github.com/bryanveloso/dotfiles/master/suit_up.sh | sh

## Inspirations

Crazy ideas beget other crazy ideas, and for those I have these fine people to thank:

* [Kenneth Reitz][1] for making me aware of Z shell.
* [Geoffrey Grosenbach][2] [for elaborating][3] on how awesome zsh can look.
* [Robby Russell][4] for the amazing [oh-my-zsh][5] project.
* [Ben Hoskings][6] for an [prime example of dotfiles][7] to work off of.
